# About
This project was meant to add to the typical sudoku solver project. It uses recursive backtracking to go through and solve any given sudoku puzzle, imported from a text file. However, it can also generate a sudoku puzzle. It will randomly populate a blank grid with some numbers, and then use recursive backtracking to obtain a solution. Then it will remove some of the numbers from the grid, so that the user can fill in their own solutions.
